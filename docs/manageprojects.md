# üìã Manage Your Projects

HBS faculty members, doctoral students, and pre-approve post-docs can be project owners.
The **Project Owner** follows the Account and Project Provisioning Process:

- The first step is to [request access to the RCP](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/account/new) as a project owner.
- After accessing the RCP, you can [request space for your project](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/projectspace/new). 

The Project Owner is responsible for the following:

- [Managing access to their projects](#manage-your-team) to the platform and
- [Specifying what launchers in what configurations](#choose-launcher-configurations) are available to their research team for their particular project
- [Monitoring cloud usage and costs](#view-costs) 

## Manage Your Team

The Project Owner can invite additional HBS research team members such as RAs or doctoral students by asking them to request an account using the [same URL as above](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/account/new). 
External team members must request access with [this URL](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/guest/research-computing-platform/account/new). Please send the appropriate links to your project team members so that they can onboard.

Once your team member has an account, [contact RCS](mailto:research@hbs.edu) to request that they be added to your project.

    **Note:** Users must **log into their RCP account** at least once before they can be added to a project.

## Get Started with a New Project

Once you have [requested your project](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/projectspace/new) and it has been created, the Project Owner will need to choose what applications are available to the team.

## View Costs

Project owners can monitor costs by navigating to the cost dashboard in the Project Management tab. To see the costs of all current launchers, select ‚ÄúView All‚Äù in the cost view.
