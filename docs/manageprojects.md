# 📋 Manage Your Projects

HBS faculty members and doctoral students can be project owners.
The **Project Owner** follows the Account and Project Provisioning Process:

- The first step is to [request access to the RCP](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/account/new) as a project owner.
- After accessing the RCP, you can [request space for your project](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/projectspace/new).

Please be aware that during the project request process, you will need to specify the data security level and provide compliance documentation of the project will have level 3 or 4 data.

The Project Owner is responsible for the following:

- [Managing access to their projects](#manage-your-team) to the platform and
- [Specifying what launchers in what configurations](#choose-launcher-configurations) are available to their research team for their particular project
- [Monitoring cloud usage and costs](#view-costs)
- [Configuring Services for use with the project](#configure-services)

## Manage Your Team

The Project Owner can invite additional HBS research team members such as RAs or doctoral students by asking them to request an account using the [same URL as above](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/account/new). 
External team members must request access with [this URL](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/guest/research-computing-platform/account/new). Please send the appropriate links to your project team members so that they can onboard.

Once your team member has an account, [contact RCS](mailto:research@hbs.edu) to request that they be added to your project.

    **Note:** Users must **log into their RCP account** at least once before they can be added to a project.

## Get Started with a New Project

Once you have [requested your project](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/projectspace/new) and it has been created, the Project Owner will need to choose what applications are available to the team.

The circle represents an annual or project budget.  The lighter blue color represents the total accured costs and the darker blue color represents the remaining unused budget. Dollar values are displayed for each month within a specified quarter. To change to another quarter, select the quarter from the first drop down.  To select a prior fiscal year, select the fiscal year from the second drop down.  If costs exceed what would the allocated budget for that quarter, costs will be shown in red.

To see how each launcher and session have contributed to the overall incurred costs, select the view all button.
