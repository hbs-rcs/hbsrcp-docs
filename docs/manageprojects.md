# ðŸ“‹ Manage Your Projects

HBS faculty members, doctoral students, and pre-approve post-docs can be project owners.
The Project Owner follows the Account and Project Provisioning Process:

- The first step is to [request access to the RCP](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/account/new) as a project owner.
- After accessing the RCP, you can [request space for your project](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/projectspace/new). 

The Project Owner can [invite team members](#manage-your-team) to the platform and reqest to add or remove them to their projects.

The Project Owner can [specify what launchers in what configurations](#choose-launcher-configurations) are available to their research team for their particular project.

The Project Owner is responsible for [monitoring cloud usage and costs](#view-costs). 

## Manage Your Team

The Project Owner can invite additional HBS research team members such as RAs or doctoral students by asking them to request an account using the [same URL as above](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/account/new). 
External team members must request access with [this URL](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/guest/research-computing-platform/account/new). Please send the appropriate links to your project team members so that they can onboard.

Once your team member has an account, [contact RCS](mailto:research@hbs.edu) to request that they be added to your project.

## Get Started with a New Project

Once you have [requested your project](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/projectspace/new) and it has been created, the Project Owner will need to choose what applications are available to the team.

## View Costs

We have developed a cloud cost chargeback model with the following principles:
    
- Positive experience for faculty to use the platform and to experiment 
- Reasonable and clear to faculty 
- Incentive to use resources wisely 
- Controls to monitor and manage costs, including faculty-level AWS subaccounts and code optimization in partnership with RCS and IT Research Technologies 
- Alignment with the research budget planning process 

During the initial rollout, all cloud costs incurred on the platform will be covered through an automatic reimbursement process. After the initial rollout, cloud costs incurred on the platform will be covered through an automatic reimbursement process up to a limit, set to cover most faculty and usage. Costs above the limit will be charged to research budgets, with increases to budgets as needed through the research budget supplement request process. We will gather data on cloud costs and usage to validate our budget assumptions.
