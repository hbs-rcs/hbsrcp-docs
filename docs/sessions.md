# 🐚 Running Sessions
## Using Launchers 
### Selecting and Starting Launchers
Click on your project and select one of the available **launchers** to create a new **session**. Note that each launcher has multiple configurations of CPUs/GPUs and memory, and that these vary by [software](software.md).

Select your software, name the session, and choose the CPU/GPU and memory allocation that is most appropriate for your work. Keep in mind that there are different [costs](/hbsrcp-docs/billing/) associated with each configuration. **Starting a launcher for the first time can take 5-10 minutes.**

Once your session has been provisioned, click on "Start" to open the software in your browser. This will take a few minutes.

### Stopping Launchers
If you have finished with your session, but plan to return to it, please ensure you have **stopped** it. The stop option will appear after clicking on the hamburger menu to the right of the Connect button. Keeping the session running, even when you’re not actively using it, will incur charges, whereas a stopped session only incurs minor storage costs.

### Terminating Launchers
If you anticipate no longer needing a launcher, please **terminate** it. The terminate option will appear after clicking on the hamburger menu to the right of the Start button. A terminated launcher will incur no costs. Keep in mind that once you terminate a launcher, downloaded packages (e.g., R packages) will be removed and unavailable for future use (i.e., if you restart a launcher you will need to recreate your environment).
