# Help and support

The RCS team works directly with HBS IT to support the RCP.  If you run into any problems please let us know! The best way to reach us directly is via email at 
[research@hbs.edu](mailto:research@hbs.edu).  We have dedicated individuals triaging this email inbox and can address your issue in short order.   

Often specific issues require specific expertise and we will make every attempt to get the right person addressing your question as quickly as we can.  

To help us with our triaging process, **please include as much information as you can**.  This may include:
1.  Error logs
2.  messages or dialog boxes
3.  screenshots of issues you are seeing
4.  The time of day the issue happened
5.  What specific tool you were using at the time

If you think a conversation will help expedite resolution, please provide your availability so that team member can schedule time to discuss your issue with you.  Typically, these discussions work best over Zoom with screen sharing.

Our support team is always happy to assist you.
