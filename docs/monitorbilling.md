# ðŸ’µ Billing overview

We have developed a cloud cost chargeback model with the following principles:
    - Positive experience for faculty to use the platform and to experiment 
    - Reasonable and clear to faculty 
    - Incentive to use resources wisely 
    - Controls to monitor and manage costs, including faculty-level AWS subaccounts 
        and code optimization in partnership with RCS and IT Research Technologies 
    - Alignment with the research budget planning process 

During the initial rollout, all cloud costs incurred on the platform will be covered through an automatic reimbursement process. After the initial rollout, cloud costs incurred on the platform will be covered through an automatic reimbursement process up to a limit, set to cover most faculty and usage. Costs above the limit will be charged to research budgets, with increases to budgets as needed through the research budget supplement request process. We will gather data on cloud costs and usage to validate our budget assumptions.
