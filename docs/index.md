# The HBS Research Computing Platform (RCP) in the cloud will transform how computational research is supported at HBS.

# Designed to meet the demands of modern research, this platform provides an array of computational tools in a project-based centralized system that facilitates collaboration, data management, and compliance.   

The user-friendly interface has been specifically designed with the business researcher in mind. It is customized to your unique projects, seamlessly integrating advanced data science tools, scalable computing power, and cutting-edge collaboration features.

The RCP will have an Initial Release in February 2025 with early adopters to gather feedback, facilitate iterative improvements, validate enhancements, and optimize resources, followed by an Expanded Release available to all HBS researchers and projects in Fall 2025.

If you have a project that you think will be a good fit for the Initial Release, [contact Research Computing Services](mailto:research@hbs.edu).
