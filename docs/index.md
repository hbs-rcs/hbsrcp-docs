# The HBS Research Computing Platform (RCP) in the cloud will transform how computational research is supported at HBS.

# Designed to meet the demands of modern research, this platform provides an array of computational tools in a project-based centralized system that facilitates collaboration, data management, and compliance.

## What Does the RCP Offer? 

  - Extensible cloud storage and compute power, including graphics processing units (GPUs)
  - Access to popular data science and statistical analysis tools including Jupyter Notebook, RStudio, Spyder, STATA, and Visual Studio Code, 
  and cloud services like Amazon SageMaker
  - Project-based interface and customizable workbench based on user experience research

## What About Cloud Costs?

  - All costs will be covered by DRFD and HBS IT through FY26 using a reimbursement model. At the end of FY26, usage and outcomes will be evaluated, and a long-term cost-coverage strategy for the platform will be developed. Additional details will be shared as they become available.
  - To ensure cost transparency, Project Owners can view cloud usage and associated costs directly within the RCP.
  - As the platform is a shared institutional resource, we encourage the research community to act as responsible stewards by actively monitoring and managing usage and costs, and by using the platform efficiently. The RCP includes built-in cost management controls, such as faculty-level AWS subaccounts. RCS is also available to assist with code optimization and data management strategies to support efficient use of the platform.
  - Through the remainder of FY25 and throughout FY26, cloud usage and cost data will be collected to inform the development of a sustainable budget model for the RCP.
  - To learn more about Cloud Costs on RCP, please see our [billing section](/hbsrcp-docs/billing/)


## Getting Started
   
1.  [Request an account](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/account/new) and invite your team to request accounts:
    - [HBS users](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/account/new) (For users with hbs.edu credentials)
    - [Guest collaborators](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/guest/research-computing-platform/account/new) (Only for users who **do not** have HBS credentials)
2.  Login to the platform: [https://researchcloud.hbs.edu/](https://researchcloud.hbs.edu/)
3.  Project owners: [Request a project space](https://secure.hbs.edu/accountManagement/secure/research-computing-platform/projectspace/new)

    **Note that before requesting a project space,** project owners:
      
      - must be an HBS faculty member, doctoral student, or pre-approved postdoc
      - must have an RCP account
      - must have logged into their RCP account at least once
    
    **Project owners must put in their own requests**; one may not request a project on behalf of someone else.

4. [Use the RCP](software.md) and [manage your project](manageprojects.md)
