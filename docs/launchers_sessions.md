# 🐚 Starting Launchers and Running Sessions
## Selecting and Starting Launchers
Click on your project and select one of the available **launchers** to create a new **session**. Note that each launcher has multiple configurations of CPUs/GPUs and memory, and that these vary by [software](storage_software.md).

Select your software, name the session, and choose the CPU/GPU and memory allocation that is most appropriate for your work. Keep in mind that there are different [costs](/hbsrcp-docs/billing/) associated with each configuration. **Starting a launcher for the first time can take 5-10 minutes.**

Once your session has been provisioned, click on "Connect" to open the software in your browser.

### Starting Sessions
Once a launcher is provisioned, it will appear as one of your sessions at the top of your project space Workbench. Click on the "Start" button to re-start the session. It will take a few minutes to load, and then the "Connect" button will appear. Click on the "Connect" button to open the software in your browser.

### Stopping Sessions
If you have finished with your session, but plan to return to it, please ensure you have **stopped** it. The stop option will appear after clicking on the hamburger menu to the right of the Connect button. Keeping the session running, even when you’re not actively using it, will incur charges, whereas a stopped session only incurs minor storage costs.

### Terminating Launchers
If you anticipate no longer needing a launcher, please **terminate** it. The terminate option will appear after clicking on the hamburger menu to the right of the Start button. A terminated launcher will incur no costs. Keep in mind that once you terminate a launcher, downloaded packages (e.g., R packages) will be removed and unavailable for future use (i.e., if you restart a launcher you will need to recreate your environment).
